Polymorphism
-It refers to the ability of a single entity,such as method or class,to take on multiple forms.There are two types of polymorphism.


-Compile Time Polymorphism(Method Overloading)
    -This occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but
    different parameters (either a different number of parameters or different types of parameters).
    -The compiler determines which method to call based on the number and types of arguments passed during the method invocation

-Runtime Polymorphism(Method Overriding)
    -This occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.
    -The decision of which method to call is made at runtime based on the actual object type.
